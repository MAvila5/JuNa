                Receiving and applying constructive feedback is vital for growth
                in writing lab reports that are of publishable quality.
                Inorganic Chemistry laboratory (4610L) is one of the highest
                level lab courses a chemistry major takes therefore
                comprehension and critical thinking will be expanded upon when
                moving forward in future lab reports. With that being said it
                will be a learning curve to approve the standards of my
                professor and as well as myself. In this particular laboratory
                experiment, my lab partner and I synthesized tetrahedral mimt
                complexes of Co(II),
                Co(mimt)<small>2</small>(NO<small>3</small>)<small>2</small> and
                (NO<small>3</small>)<small>2</small> x H<small>2</small>O. These
                molecules are known as coordination compounds, a class of
                compounds in which a central metal atom, typically a transition
                element is surrounded by a group of ions or molecules, called
                ligands. Applicable skills that were involved in the experiment
                were effective communication, synthesis of a given complex, as
                well as effective use of characterization techniques such as IR
                spectroscopy and melting point apparatus.

                In this experiment, cis and trans isomers of copper (II)
                glycinate are prepared and characterized by IR spectroscopy. The
                direct reaction of copper(II) acetate monohydrate and glycine
                results in an equilibrium mixture of the two isomers. Copper
                (II) glycinate gives rise to a square planar configuration of
                the oxygen and nitrogen atoms around the copper leading to two
                geometrically different ways of positioning the glycines.
                Compounds that have the same formula but different structures
                are called isomers and the special type of isomerism present
                here is called geometric isomerism. With different
                configurations comes different molecular symmetry; because the
                isomers have different point group symmetries, they can be
                distinguished on the basis of their vibrational spectra . The
                cis isomer of copper (II) glycinate is a C<small>2v</small>

                acetylation addition reaction took place. The use of thin-layer
                chromatography can aid in identifying which products will form
                as a TLC plate will differentiate between ferrocene, monoacetyl
                and diacetyl ferrocene based on their polarity.

                In this experiment, Di- μ -chlorodichlorodiethylenedipalladium
                (II), an organopalladium dimer is prepared in a two step
                synthesis and characterized via IR Spectroscopy and melting
                point. Palladium(II) chloride is reacted with benzonitrile to
                form dichlorobis(benzonitrile)palladium(II) and it is
                subsequently exposed to ethylene gas to form the desired
                product. The finished product is a square planar configuration
                with the palladium metals having an oxidation state of 2+. The
                bridging ligands are chlorine that connect the palladium metal
                and the terminal ligands is the ethylene. Ethylene is an π −
                acceptor ligand that is capable of forming stable bonds with
                metals with a metal with a large number of electrons. The bond
                between ethylene and Pd<small><sup>2+</sup></small> is due to
                donation from ethylene, the ligand, and as well as π −
                acceptance from metal to ligand.

                In this experiment, Wilkinson's catalyst will be synthesized
                from rhodium (III) chloride and excess triphenylphosphine. The
                synthesized Wilkinson’s catalyst will then go through a
                substitution reaction with its chloro ligand to a bromo ligand,
                and the subsequent product will be reacted with an aldehyde.
                Each subsequent reaction product will be characterized via IR
                and NMR spectroscopy. The first successful homogeneous system
                developed for the reduction of olefins involved the use of
                RhCl(PPh<small>3</small>)<small>3</small>, called Wilkinson's
                catalyst. Most catalytic reactions for hydrogenation of double
                bonds in organic compounds require high hydrogen pressures and
                high temperatures. It was found that some organometallic
                compounds can catalyze such hydrogenation reactions under mild
                reaction conditions.

                In this experiment, the trans effect is observed in the

                trans-Dichloro(dipyridine)platinum(ll) will be confirm to be
                synthesized by distinguishing the modes caused by the point
                group of each complex. The cis and trans have differet points
                thus having different symmetric and asymmetric modes that are IR

                In this experiment, copper (II) and cobalt (II) complexes are
                synthesized. The sodium salt of the saccharin species is In
                saccharin, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen p orbital
                is extensively conjugated with the d orbitals of the sulfur. The
                electrons are not, therefore, available for donation to the
                metal, and it is difficult to prepare metal saccharinates by
                direct reaction with saccharin itself. In the saccharide salt,
                however, the second nitrogen lone pair is readily available for
                donation, and the metal saccharinates form readily.
